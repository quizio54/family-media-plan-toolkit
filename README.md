# Family Media Plan Toolkit

A practical, open-source resource for parents to create a Family Media Plan based on research from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the work of Dr. Yolanda Reid Chassiakos.

## Purpose

This toolkit provides a structured, fill-in-the-blank template that helps families set healthy digital media habits. It translates evidence-based recommendations into actionable steps that parents can adapt to their own household.

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Template**: Open the [`Media_Plan_Template.md`](Media_Plan_Template.md) file to see the core framework.
2. **Customize for Your Family**: Fill in the sections that match your children’s ages, your family’s values, and your daily routine.
3. **Review the Guidance**: Each section includes brief explanations and tips drawn from the AAP’s “Children, Adolescents, and Digital Media” technical report.
4. **Print or Save**: Once completed, you can print the plan or keep a digital copy to revisit and adjust as your children grow.

## Structure

- **Media_Plan_Template.md** – The main template with sections for screen‑time limits, co‑viewing best practices, digital citizenship, and family media agreements.
- **README.md** – This overview and usage guide.
- **Future Additions** – Planned additions include age‑specific worksheets, sample completed plans, and translations.

## Contributing

This is a collaborative project. If you are a researcher, pediatrician, educator, or parent with ideas for improving the template, please open an issue or submit a pull request. We especially welcome contributions that make the content more accessible and inclusive.

## Credits

Developed with guidance from Dr. Yolanda Reid Chassiakos, a leading expert on children and adolescents’ digital media use and author of the AAP’s “Children and Adolescents and Digital Media Technical Report.” The template follows the AAP’s recommendation that every family create a personalized media plan.
